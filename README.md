# Desktop Processes Integration

Home Assistant custom integration for retrieving and controlling process volumes for a PC.
 Built to communicate with the [Desktop Control Tablet Server](https://github.com/gannonprudhomme/Desktop-Control-Tablet-Server).

## Installation

TODO

## Development

Due to Docker not allowing host networking on Windows, you must install Home Assistant manually
(`pip install wheel`, `pip install homeassistant`, `hass -c config/`) and put this repo
in the `config/` folder.
